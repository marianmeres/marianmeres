## @marianmeres (A Note on How Things Get Built Around Here)

### The Before Times

I produced bugs by hand. I consumed Stack Overflow. I survived.

### 2025+

I let AI join the party. Some of my repos are now 90% AI-typed, some remain 90% human-typed. All are 100% architected by me. I prompt, I design, I review, I iterate obsessively. The AI is my tireless junior dev who never complains about rewrites. If something works beautifully, I share the credit. If it breaks, I share the blame.
